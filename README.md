# Recipe To-Do List Application Project

The objective of this project was to create an OOP-based web application based on one of your hobbies. I chose to make a recipe to-do list application as I love cooking.
This is a full-stack web application following the Enterprise Architecture Model, using Java for the back-end and JavaScript for the front-end.
